    Data types
        A data type is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational, or logical operations can be applied to it without causing an error.

    Common Categories of Data Types:
        1.  Primitive (or Built-in) Data Types:
                Integers: Whole numbers
                Floating-Point Numbers: Numbers with decimal points
                Characters: Single letters, symbols, or numbers
                Booleans: Represent truth values, either true or false.
                Strings: Sequences of characters (e.g., "Hello World", "123 Main Street").
        2.  Complex (or Non-Primitive/User-Defined) Data Types:
                Arrays: Ordered collections of elements of the same data type (e.g., a list of integers [1, 2, 3]).
                Classes/Objects: In object-oriented programming, these are blueprints for creating objects that encapsulate both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).
    Variable
        a variable is a named storage location that holds a value. Think of it as a labeled box or container in the computer's memory where you can store a piece of information. This information can then be retrieved, used, and changed throughout the execution of a program.
            Name (Identifier): Every variable has a unique name (also called an identifier) that you, the programmer, choose.
            Value: This is the actual piece of data stored in the variable. It could be a number, a piece of text, a true/false value, etc.

        Why are Variables Important?
            a.  Store and manipulate data: Programs need to work with information, and variables provide the means to hold and process that information.

            b.  Make programs dynamic: Instead of hardcoding values directly into the program, variables allow programs to work with different inputs and produce different outputs based on those inputs.

            c.  Create reusable code: You can write functions or blocks of code that operate on variables, making them general-purpose and reusable for various data.

            d.  Track state: Variables help keep track of the current state of a program (e.g., a game's score, a user's logged-in status).
